## Description
A project aimed at offering guidance on marketing strategy to Instacart, the online grocery company, by analyzing customer purchases.

## Objectives
The goals of the analysis were to offer Instacart a segmentation of their customer base into profiles to guide targeting marketing campaigns, as well as to analyze product preferences. 

## Data
Several Instacart tables on customers, orders, and departments were joined into one table for analysis comprising 32 columns and over 32 million rows.

## Recommendations
After analyzing the Instacart database using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python and Pandas, we compiled figures and recorded stats in an Excel report (excerpts available here as .png files) with our recommendations.

## Languages and Technologies
This project was carried out with Python using Pandas dataframes and NumPy in Jupyter Notebooks.
